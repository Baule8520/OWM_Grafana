# OWM_to_Grafana

I use this Python Script to add forecast data to my [self build weather station](https://github.com/PaulusElektrus/ESP32-Wetterstation).

The forecast data is from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

The data is downloaded and then pushed to an InfluxDB where it is diplayed with Grafana.
